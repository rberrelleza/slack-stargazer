Slack Stargazer
=================

Get a slack notification when someone stars your Github repo. This is a fork of https://github.com/alexdebrie/stargazer

## Customize
To have it use your own slack channel and notifications, do the following:
- [![Remix on Glitch](https://cdn.glitch.com/2703baf2-b643-4da7-ab91-7ee2a2d00b5b%2Fremix-button.svg)](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/remix/slack-stargazer)
- Create a webhook in the Slack channel that will receive the notifications
- Add it to `.env` as WEBHOOK_URL
- Create a github webhook with the `watch` permission, and the URL of your glitch app as the payload.
